# Controlling the Lego Technics Hub (Hub 2) via Bluetooth (btle) using a Rasperry Pi 4B
A school project that shows how to control a Lego Jeep with Bluetooth on the Raspberry Pi 4B.

Currently:
  - Motors can be registered at the Hub 2 Hub
  - Motors can be combined and registered at the Hub 2 Hub (for synchronized command execution)
  - Motors can be turned by Degree and by Time
  - a TestScript that shows what can be done is available
  
Next:
  - Query over-/under-current of Motor, resp. STALL status
  - better Notification-thread implementation
